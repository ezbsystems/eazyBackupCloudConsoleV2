## üîê Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Customer passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash()`
- Sensitive data (SMTP passwords, tokens) are encrypted
- All database queries use parameterized statements
- Session management with secure cookies

### Access Control
- MSPs can only access their own customers
- API endpoints validate user permissions
- Activity logging for audit trails
- Rate limiting on login attempts

### Stripe Security
- Webhook signature verification
- Secure token storage
- OAuth state parameter validation
- Regular token refresh

## üìä Database Schema

### Key Tables
- **msp_reseller_msp_settings**: MSP account configuration and Stripe integration
- **msp_reseller_customers**: End-customer accounts managed by MSPs
- **msp_reseller_invoices**: Billing and payment tracking
- **msp_reseller_activity_log**: Comprehensive activity logging

### Relationships
- Each MSP can have multiple customers
- Each customer can have multiple services
- Each service generates invoices based on billing cycles
- All activities are logged with timestamps and metadata
