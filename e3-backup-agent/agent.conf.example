# E3 Backup Agent - example configuration
#
# This file demonstrates both enrollment methods:
#  1) MSP/RMM token enrollment (silent rollouts)
#  2) End-user email/password enrollment (interactive/tray)
#
# After successful enrollment the agent rewrites the config to include:
#   client_id, agent_id, agent_token
# and clears enrollment_token / enroll_email / enroll_password.
